## Ml Zeeshan's introduction to Uloom ul hadith

This science helps identify whether a hadith is authentic. The two primary skills to gain by studying this science are Takhreej and Tahqeequl Isnad.

Takhreej: Sourcing a hadith, e.g. X hadith is in Sahih Muslim 

Tahqeequl Isnad: Analysing the chain of the hadith by looking at the narrators and providing a grading.

Those two things are only possible if one is familiar with the technical terms the scholars in this field use. Once one familiarises themselves with the terms of this science, it's easier to navigate the books of hadith.

The origin of this science goes back to when scholars began using terms to describe phenomena they saw concerning hadith. Scholars started using terms like Sahih and Daeef, but the definitions were not penned down. Then, discussions regarding hadith began to be written down.

Imam Muslim includes discussions he deems relevant in the muqaddima to his sahih.
Imam Tirmidhi writes Kitabul 3illal, discussing the defects regarding hadith.
Imam Abu Dawud wrote a letter to the people of Makkah when he authored his sahih, explaining some of his usul for hadith.

None of these were comprehensive for studying the science of hadith. Students of this science would sit in the majalis of a hadith scholar, collecting the hadith being narrated and noting any remarks the scholar mentions regarding the hadith/narrators. As a competent student, you would begin analysing the hadith you have collected by finding out what scholars say regarding certain narrators and sifting through your collection to accurately determine a grading for your hadiths. That lengthy process was the pathway to becoming a hadith scholar. There was no single book as a sufficient introduction to the science. 

Muhaddith Al-Faasil by Ramahurmuzi (360H) is considered the first comprehensive book on the rules of narration. Discusses topics such as what is the appropriate age to narrate hadith. 

The first book that provides an introduction to the science of hadith is معرفة علوم الحديث لأبو عبد الله الحاكم النيسابوري  (405H).

Ibn Salah gathered the information in earlier books and codified it all within his book. His book changed the field, and most if not all books after him are reliant on his book. Hence there are many mukhtasars of his book, one of the most famous being Imam Nawawi's (التقريب والتيسير لمعرفة سنن البشير النذير). Annotations (Ibn Hajr, Zarkashi), corrections (إصلاح كتاب ابن الصلاح لمغلطاي) and commentaries are all written on Ibn Salah's book.

Important works with independent research or beneficial points not found elsewhere to use when studying Ibn Salah. 
1. النكت على كتاب إبن الصلاح لابن حجر
2. تدريب الراوي في شرح تقريب النواوي - الإمام السيوطي (Awamah Edition 5 volumes with important hashiya)
3. الموقظة في علم مصطلح الحديث - الإمام الذهبي (with the sharh of Sheikh Hatim)
(Other books could be added but would make it too much. e.g. Fathul Mugheeth) 
Why Sheikh Hatim along with these classical imams?
When Imam Bukhari has not specified what he means when he uses the term Y the only way to infer what he means is to check all or most usages and analyse his usage. This is called الاستقراء, which splits into الاستقراء التام (going through and checking every usage of the term) and الاستقراء الناقص is analysing a subset of the usages. Scholars in most cases quote previous scholars who have done the reading. Sheikh Hatim has redone the الاستقراء and provides new beneficial points based on his reading.


## Ibn Salah's Muqaddima to his Muqaddima
He begins by highlighting the importance of the science of hadith.
أَنْفَعِ الْفُنُونِ النَّافِعَةِ - Because it is the science that equips you to distinguish truth from falsehood. It makes you question the sources of things and investigate whether it's true or just hearsay.

وَهُوَ مِنْ أَكْثَرِ الْعُلُومِ تَوَلُّجًا فِي فُنُونِهَا - Every other science is based on isnaad therefore it is the science with enters most into other sciences because it tells you how to deal with isnaads.

لِذَلِكَ كَثُرَ غَلَطُ الْعَاطِلِينَ مِنْهُ مِنْ مُصَنِّفِي الْفُقَهَاءِ، وَظَهَرَ الْخَلَلُ فِي كَلَامِ الْمُخِلِّينَ بِهِ مِنَ الْعُلَمَاءِ - Very often in the books of fiqh you spot many mistakes by scholars when it comes to quoting hadith. 

The 2nd paragraph is Ibn Salah having a go at the many at his time who had become occupied with the sama majalis and left the actual objectives of the science of hadith. They would go to majalis just to listen to hadith and collect asaneed. They left the root of the science, knowing which hadith are Maqbool or Mardud, the actual meaning of the hadith etc. 

The 3rd paragraph explains what he has done and the 65 categories he has split the book into. He responds to the possible objection regarding why he chose 65. He highlights that every narrator and every hadith is different from another. You could enumerate many different categories if you wanted to, but he says that would be لَكِنَّهُ نَصَبٌ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَرَبٍ

## معرفة الصحيح من الحديث

أَنَّ الْحَدِيثَ عِنْدَ أَهْلِهِ يَنْقَسِمُ إِلَى: صَحِيحٍ، وَحَسَنٍ، وَضَعِيفٍ

This 3 level tiering even though he says it's according to the Muhadithoon it seems to be from his reading of their works. The concepts mentioned here there is not any major ikhtilaf on. 
 - if a hadith meets X -> it is accepted
 - if a hadith meets Y -> it is still accepted 
 - if a hadith meets Z (i.e. doesn't meet X or Y) -> it is weak/not accepted
  
There is a khilaf on the istahlaha used to describe those categories. Mainly on the term حَسَن  and what earlier scholars actually meant when they used the term. There is no ikhtilaf on what Ibn Salah describes as حَسَن being accepted. The حَسَن category is due to Ibn Salah noticing scholars accepting ahadith which did not meet the criteria of صَحِيح.

الْحَدِيثُ الصَّحِيحُ: فَهُوَ الْحَدِيثُ الْمُسْنَدُ الَّذِي يَتَّصِلُ إِسْنَادُهُ بِنَقْلِ الْعَدْلِ الضَّابِطِ عَنِ الْعَدْلِ الضَّابِطِ إِلَى مُنْتَهَاهُ، وَلَا يَكُونُ شَاذًّا، وَلَا مُعَلَّلًا

 - 5 conditions need to be met for a hadith to be met

A definition should be comprehensive without needing extra words so one criticism that can be mentioned here is the word الْمُسْنَد is superflous since he mentions connection chain (if we take it to mean a connected chain).

معاني المسنَد:
١ - متصّل
٢ - إسناد فقط أي ذو إسناد
e.g. Seerah ibn Hisham is a musnad text, it has chains but not every chain is connected
٣ - مرتّب على صحابة
e.g. Musnad Imam Ahmed they are ordered based on the Sahabi narrating

That is different from a مسنِد which is a contemporary term to describe a person who goes around collecting chains - رجل ذو اسانيد. So you would have the Musnid of area Y, and he was the person all/most of the chains of that area go through. 

Then, he justifies his definition by explaining how it has removed other non-sahih categories.  

Ml Zee:
The schorlarly difference in grading (sahih or not) is due to either the usul is applied differently or the usul itself is differed on.

The bulk of the time it is due to the first (i.e. 5 conditions). Everyone agrees the Rawi needs to precise but they differ on what constitutes being precise. 
<!-- TODO mention how Hanafis/Malikis differ in acceptance of Mursal -->


When a scholar says "هَذَا حَدِيثٌ صَحِيحٌ" -> meets the 5 conditions, not that it is definitively from Nabi SAW. This nuance gives wiggle room for scholars. Therefore, you see scholars not going along with a Sahih hadith sometimes. 

He reasons for the above because Sahih only means one trustworthy person narrated it and they are capable of error. He adds the last clause to exclude sahih khabrul wahid which the Ummah has accepted and its mutawatir in concept and treated as it. (Similar to the concept of Mashur in Hanafi Usul) He does this to respond to the possible objection of someone saying but we have Sahih khabrul wahid which are treated as definitive. 

### فَوَائِدُ مُهِمَّةٌ

1. It is better to refrain from saying this chain is the most sahih ala itlaaq because you will get instances where that sanad has made a mistake. E.g. Imam Malik is considered to be from the top narrators but at times you see he made a mistake. (e.g. lying down before or after fajr)

> نقاد الحديث - Term used to describe the experts of hadith. (Imams who did jarh wa ta3deel). From them you have the likes of Imam Ahmad, Ali bin Madini, Yahya bin Mu'in, Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim, Imam Tirmidhi etc

>  عَلِيِّ بْنِ الْمَدِينِيِّ - Was very old around during the mihna and tried to resist but under fear of punishment he affirmed to the statement of Quran being mahklooq. Story of him (some scholars question it's authenticity) when Imam Ahmad was debating Ibn Abi Du'ad (leading Mu'tazili of the time) and Imam Ahmad quoted a hadith that proves that Quran is not makhlooq. They went to Ali bin Madini and asked whether said hadith was authentic and he response Sahih. They kept pressuring him to say something regarding it so he said fi hi fulan fulan huwa bawwal ala aqibayhi (aka bedoiun) instead of weakening it. When they went back and repeated it to Imam Ahmad he said you got this from Ali, no one else could have told you that and he stopped narrating from Ali bin Madini. (Siyar)
>
> Some of later scholars tried to say something about Ali bin Madini but Imam Dhahabi said (TODO check in siyar what he says)
> Nuqta here: Sometimes things are significant at the time but in the larger view of history no one cares, it becomes just a footnote in history. He was an old guy who got pressured and said something, now it means nothing he is still an imam in the field but at the time it was a scandalous issue.
2. There are 4 different interpretations of Ibn Salah means in this paragraph. 
   1. Ibn Hajar & others: Ibn Salah is saying we can no longer independently grade hadith
   2. Sh Awaamah & Sh Hamza Malibari: Ibn Salah refers explicitly to the Ajzaa. Ajzaa are these later private collections of hadiths that people would have of their sanads and sometimes those sanads would even go through the major hadith books. Therefore, if these private collections contain a unique sanad you cannot grade that because in the later generations, people stopped checking rigorously for the conditions of narrators. These ajzaa are also not held up to the high standards that the hadith books were held up to re precision etc. This interpretation is supported by the fact Ibn Salah himself graded ahadith.
   3. Imam Suyuti: We can't grade hadiths as Sahih li Nafisihi because we can no longer find the hidden defects in the chain because we are too far from the time and have no vouching from previous scholars. However, if we can find some corroboration, we can grade it Sahih li Ghayrihi.
   4. Sheikh Hatim Al-Awni: We can do everything except naful 3illah so we can authenticate the isnad but not the hadith. e.g. we can say this chain is sahih but not this hadith is sahih. (Ml Zeeshan: this is quite similar to Imam Suyuti, but the terms used differ.)
Ml Zeeshan: 2 & 4 are the most convincing but the conclusion 

3rd important point is to answer the objection re isn't the Muwatta of Imam Malik the first sahih collection with the claim of being sahih.
 - It's not established that Imam Malik said that his muwatta was a collection of Sahih but Imam Muslim and Bukhari very clearly call their works a Jami3 of Sahih
 - There are ahadith in the Muwatta that are Balaghaat (Balagani Narrations)
 - Imam Shafi passed away before Bukhari did his Sahih so his statement doesn't apply
 - Also Imam Shafi's statement is regarding "most correct" does not equate to everything being authentic

There was an opinion put forward by some scholars that Sahih Muslim was more Sahih than Sahih Bukhari so he answers this objection by you are wrong and the qawl can be interpreted as saying "Imam Muslim does not bring hadiths without chains after his introduction like Imam Bukhari" so it's more preferred because its more straightforward to use. 

Ibn Salah says Imam Muslim is referring to the conditions of Sahih being mujma alay not the actual hadith themselves so others may disagree with the application of those conditions to some of the hadiths in Sahih Muslim.

100/150 year Imam Hakim write Al-Mustadrak ala Sahihayn, the correction of the sahihayn. He attempted to narrate the hadith that fulfilled the conditions of the Sahihayn or one of them but not mentioned in Sahihayn. Ibn Salah uses this as a single evidence to refute the claim that there are few sahih narrations not in Sahihayn even though as Ibn Salah said there is a discussion that some of them are weak because it still shows there are many ahadith that are sahih not in Sahihayn. Imam Hakim included 4 types of narrators: those in Sahihayn, those in Bukhari alone, those in Muslim alone, and those He considered sahih but not in Sahihayn.

Ml Zeeshan: The response to this quote of Abu Abdillah bin Akram who is a Hafidh is that he was referring to the Usul of Sunnah. It's improbable that you will find a sunnah not touched upon by Bukhari or Muslim or something Sahih that tells you a completely different way to wudhu/salah etc.

Mustakraj works attempted to find the hadith that Imam Bukhari or Muslim only mentioned a part of, so the extra wording mentioned in those books is also sahih because it's the same hadith with the same chain you can also suffice with those works. Most of these works are not found today alone but as part of the shurohaat like in Fathul Bari etc. 

Sixth Point:
Definitions:
   1. Muallaq: The beginning of the chain has been dropped e.g. I drop my teacher from the chain (could be 1 or more)
   2. Mu3dal: 2 or more consecutively 
      - So something can be both Muallaq & Mu3dal
   3. Mursal: (Most famous definition because some ikhtilaf exists) Tabi'ee narrates straight from Nabi SAW (i.e. Sahabi dropped)
   4. Munqati: Any gap in the chain (Broadest term)

1 is mostly used in reference to Bukhari. 3 and 4 are the most commonly used terms because there is a debate about 3 and 4 is used for general gaps. 2 entails a massive issue because there is a massive gap in the chain. 
<!-- TODO add quote about Mu3dal fi hi mafa'iz tanqatiu bihi a3naaqul ibil -->
Famous example of the hadith about Wahi where Prophet SAW was extremely sad and throwing himself of the mountain. 
فَتَرَ الْوَحْىُ فَتْرَةً حَتَّى حَزِنَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِيمَا بَلَغَنَا حُزْنًا غَدَا مِنْهُ مِرَارًا كَىْ يَتَرَدَّى مِنْ رُءُوسِ شَوَاهِقِ الْجِبَالِ، فَكُلَّمَا أَوْفَى بِذِرْوَةِ جَبَلٍ لِكَىْ يُلْقِيَ مِنْهُ نَفْسَهُ

We say that it says for that part of the hadith "Balagana" so it's Muallaq to Zuhri without an isnad so we are not bound to accept that, nor does it mean it's automatically Sahih.

Anything Muallaq in Sahihayn needs a separate investigation into it's authenticity. 

Imam Bukhari brings his Muallaqat in 2 ways:
  1. Seeghatul Jazm (قـال)
  2. Seeghatul Tamreed (رُوي عن)

Ibn Salah's approach is we will assume 1 to be authentic and we give weight to 2 but it's not necessarily authentic. Ibn Hajr came later and wrote the most significant work on the Muallaqaat of Bukhari (تـغـلـيـق الـتـعـلـيـق على صـحـيـح الـبـخـاري) in which he tries to find chains for all of the Muallaqaat of Bukhari and what scholars have said about it. In Fathul Bari he included a lot of the content from Tagleeq when a muallaq narration comes. Ibn Hajar has a more nuanced take on this passage in his nuqat. Ibn Hajar's approach is Jazm -> Sahih or Hasan and Tamreed -> Sahih, Hasan, Daeef (Yunjabar: strengthened from another route). Ibn Hajar says there is no single muallaq narration in Sahih Bukhari that is completely dismissed.

Everything Ibn Salah has said here regarding inclining towards the muallaq narration is true in theory and could be used back in his time but since then we have scholars complete the studies on those narrations so we can check Fathul Bari and see what Ibn Hajar says about the narration.
