##### Background: 
He was asked to teach Stanford students to deal with cold-calling situations, from which he developed content that led to the book/podcast.

Q: What is your advice for people in unplanned situations requiring them to speak?

A: Spontaneous speaking is the most common situation humans find themselves in. Listen first and ask questions to understand where the person is and what they want.

Structure the answer so it's easier for yourself and the receiver to understand. e.g., Problem Solution Benefit structure 

Q: What is the 6-step methodology you have written about to improve speaking?

A: 
The 6-step process/methodology is split into Mindset and Methodology.
1. **Manage Anxiety**
To manage anxiety, we need to deal with symptoms and sources.
    1. Symptoms
        - Deep belly breath, exhale longer than inhale
    2. Sources 
        - There is no right way to communicate, and there is no such thing as perfect communication
2. **"Maximise mediocrity in the moment"** 
so you have more mental bandwidth to focus on what you are saying, not how well you are doing it
        
3. **Mind your mindset**<br>
Reframe situations from being an attack to an opportunity to learn and grow. Reframing the situation will change our mindset from being one of defense to one of engagement and also lighten our mental load.
4. **Don't just do something**<br>
We need to listen better. There is a 3 step process called Pace, Space, and Grace.
Pace: we need to slow down so we can listen to the person properly.
Space: give them the physical and mental space to understand them better.
Grace: focus on what was said and how you feel regarding it.
5. **Structure your spontaneity**
As mentioned above, structure your message so there is a logical flow that is easy for you to follow, as well as your audience.
6. **Focus your message**
In the attempt to determine what to say we tend to ramble off a bunch of information. Instead, if we focus on the goal and needs of the audience, we can focus the message to be more relevant.
"Tell me the time. Don't build me the clock." 

**Scenarios:**
1. How do you get your point through in a busy meeting?
    - Leverage paraphrasing: use a topic already being discussed, highlight and then bring in your point
    - Use a question to grab other's attention to emphasise your point.
    - Emotion: e.g., if cost is being discussed, "I am concerned about how the cost of X is going to be managed" etc

2. As a meeting driver, how do you ensure different voices are heard?
   1. In advance of the meeting:
      - Set the meeting expectations upfront via the meeting invitation or something else. Set the expectation that we want to hear from everyone
      - Go to the usual suspects and tell them either "I know you got stuff to say. Can you wait for others to speak first?" or "I want to hear your thoughts. Can you raise anything that comes to mind?" respective if they are loud or quiet voice
   2. In the actual meeting
       - If someone is going on and on, interrupt by cherry-picking something they said and use it to bring the conversation back to the topic at hand or turn the attention to someone else "You mentioned X that's interesting I would like to hear what Y thinks of X"

3. Reducing the usage of filler words
   - Filler words hold the floor while you need to formulate your point
   - Adults teach children new concepts with filler words. They will say "erm" then explain the concept, which teaches children what comes after a filler word is essential.

    Apps to help reduce filler words:
     - Poised
     - LikeSo

    Technique: Speak so you are out of breath at the end of every sentence because it's impossible to say anything while inhaling for the next sentence.<br><br>
    
4. How do you use gestures when talking or presenting?
   - Gesture beyond your shoulders
   - When you are not gesturing, keep them in sight. Have a neutral resting place for your hands.
    2 types of gestures:
     1. Emphatic gestures
     2. Descriptive gestures 

    Record and watch yourself in 3 ways
      3. 2x speed without audio
      4. Listen without picture
      5. Audio and Video
