## Summary

Brief recount covering the main narrative of Islamic history from Prophet SAW until the formation of the nation states. The author focuses on the *main themes, _events and _significant_ turning points_* in the narrative and extracts insights and patterns.

## Chapters

### 1. Pre-Islamic Arabia
Political, historical and geographical background to Arabia at that time was of a rough life that led to rough nomadic people who gathered around wells during the heat then migrate to Yemen for the Autumn. Harsh life and scarcity of resources meant tribal protection and warfare was inevitable. ***Artistic expression is a norm for every culture/civilisation.*** Artistic expression for the Arabs due to their lifestyle was through language the richest form of it being **poetry**. Polytheism was the norm even though they held onto remnants of Ibrahim, Ismail AS (360 idols in Ka'bah).

Isolated and wedged between Roman empire in the north west, the Persian Sassanid empire in the northeast and the Aksum Abyssinian empire in the south. But were left alone as the land was not seen to be worth conquering.

>***All these factors allowed Islam to spread as it did throughout Arabia.***

### 2. Prophet SAW Life

His father Abdullah died in Madinah before his birth in 570 CE in Makkah. His mother Aminah passed away 576, grandfather Abdul Muttalib passed away 578 and was in care of his fathers brother Abu Talib. Abu Talib brought him up as a trader and he was know as Al-Amin and As-Siddiq due to his honesty in dealings. At 25 whilst doing trade for Khadija she proposed marriage to him and he accepted despite a large age difference between them.

Wahi began 610 in cave hira with Jibreel AS revealing the first 5 verses of Surah Alaq. Famous story of him coming to Khadija RA (Zammilooni Zammilooni), her sending Ali RA to do mashwara with Waraqa ibn Nawfal. Close friends and family were invited to islam. After the muslim population reached a critical mass Quraysh persecution and chastisement began, the slaves feeling the real brunt of it. Ja'far RA and others were sent to Abyssinia to seek refuge under Najashi. 

617: All out boycott of Banu Hashim  
619: عام الحزن Khadija RA passes away then Abu Talib passes away  

Nabi SAW goes to Ta'if as situation worsens in Makkah, Nabi SAW rejected by 3 brothers who led tribe and stoned by children on his departure. Famous story about Jibreel AS coming and asking if he would like Ta'if destroyed and crushed between 2 mountains. 

620: Delegation comes from Madinah  
622: Prophet SAW migrates

Madina consisted of Aws, Khazraj and Jewish tribes who were waiting for a messenger. Constitution of Madina took place as more people accepted Islam, stipulating Nabi SAW as the ultimate arbitrator, political authority and placing Madina as an Islamic state.

624: Badr, 300  
625: Uhud  
627: Khandaq  
628: Hudaybiyyah  
630: Fath ul Makkah  
632: Hajjatul wada  
632 (8 June): Nabi SAW passes away whilst resting on Aisha RA lap

### 3. Khulafa Raashida
Abu Bakr: 632 - 634 (till his death RA)

Nominated by Umar RA and accepted by the group of Sahabah RA that gathered to discuss leadership after Nabi SAW passing. East of Madina, bedouin tribes rebelled, refused to pay Zakat, among them was Musaylima Al-Kazzab. Abu Bakr RA took their refusal of Zakat as kufr and prepared to fight them. Khalid RA was appointed general to fight them and wiped out the rebels as well as Musaylima by 633.

> Wars of Apostasy cemented central rule for the Arabian peninsula which was previously all tribal bedouin rule.

Umar RA suggested the Quran should be preserved on to physical means, Abu Bakr RA eventually agreed with the suggestion and compilation of the manuscripts took place in Madina.

Umar: 634 - 644 (till his death RA)

Officially Appointed by Abu Bakr RA while on his deathbed, he inherited a politically stable state which had gained confidence militarily. He continued the raids that began before him which led to permanent conquests especially due to the Byzantine-Sassanid war (603 - 628) leaving the respective powers weaker. 

633: Armies sent to Syria and Mesopotamia (area surrounding the Euphrates, mainly modern day Iraq)
635: Khalid and army took Damascus

> Established Jizya treaty with the citizens of the previous Byzantine land to establish a clear separation between the Byzantine empire and the citizens which was effective in preventing uprising and rebellion.

636: Heraclius prepared a larger force to try defeat the Muslim army and lost to them at Yarmuk (modern day Syria/Jordan border)

> Umar travelled to Syria to establish the governorship, relieved Khalid of command of the army to prevent the attribution of success from Allah to a human and appointed Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan as the regional leader. Muawiya coming from an upbringing of ruling class Umayyads was qualified to run Syria.

636: Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas and army defeat Persians at Battle of Qadisiyya
637: Sassanid capital, Ctesiphon fell after ~2 month siege

637: Surrender of Jerusalem personally to Umar RA, famous incident of him and his slave on the donkey and initial refusal to hand over the keys

> Jews were allowed back into the city after being exiled by the Romans 70 AD  

638: Syria conquered
642: Egypt Conquered 

644: Assassinated by Persian slave whilst leading salah, slave hid behind minbar and stabbed him.

He appointed 6 companions to choose his successor and they chose Uthman RA, an early convert and a person from the ruling tribe of Umayyads.

Umar RA's reign saw the Islamic empire go from an Arab power to a cross-regional power that had jizya agreements and religious diversity throughout its new lands and an influx of wealth into the Muslim community and lands

<!--- Add hijri dates to this section -->
Uthman: 644 - 656

Appointed his foster brother Abdullah ibn Sa'd as governor of Egypt and Muawiya his cousin was already governor of Syria. He also appointed some of his other family members into positions in Iraq to continue the raids and conquests against the Persians. Obviously, this led to some accusation of Nepotism but they did not seem to gain traction.

First naval fleet was commissioned. Byzantine fleet in 646 was defeated by Christian sailors employed by the Muslim state. A clear statement of the preferred treatment under Muslim rule than previous Byzantine rule.

Muawiya led Syrian army into Armenia against the Byzantines.
Abdullah ibn Aamir led army into Persian lands.

650: Iranian Plateau (the suture zone between the northward moving Arabian plate and the Eurasian continent) conquered 
651: Khurasan conquered, Sassanid king forced to flee and was executed

Slowing military conquests leading less influx of booty and appointment of fellow Umayyads led to discontent amonsgt a few. 

> 656: Group of egyptian soldiers came to complain re policies and division of booty between civil government and army. Uthman RA agreed to come up with a solution to settle their issues and sent them back to Egypt. They intercepted a letter on their return allegedly sent by Uthman RA to Egypt ordering their execution. They returned and besieged Uthman RA in his house and established martial law. He refused to let the Madina arm itself against them as to not shed blood in the city of Nabi SAW and refused help from Muawiya in Syria. He was assassinated in his house whilst reciting from a mushaf.

Critique: Author states in the preface the goal is to give a general overview of the Islamic Historical Narrative and not for the serious history student, but does not cover significant developments during Uthman RA reign such as the canonisation of the Quranic mushaf. Missing this immense achievement especially with it's relation to how the governorship adapted to the expanding of Islam into non-arab populations whilst he chose to go into details about specific points e.g. first envoy to China sent in Uthman RA time seems to be wildly misjudged. Author must be aware of this but chose not to include it so according to him it might be better for the objective. Seems like his objective was to cover points either people are not aware of or those things which are more related to the development of the empire as opposed to the deen itself. Allah knows best.

Ali: 656 - 661

The rebels chose Ali RA to be the next Caliph which he initially refused to accept but after prompting by other senior companions at the time he accepted it. Popular sentiment to punish rebels but they still controlled Madina so instead Ali RA transferred the capital to Kufa. Muawiya refused to give bayah until they punished. Talha, Zubair and Aisha went to Kufa to convince Ali RA to take action against the rebels. 

656: Battle of the camel
> Talha and Zubair both martyred. Aisha RA escorted with military guards back to Madina and stayed away from politics till her passing away in 678.

658: Negotiations and arbitrators to resolve the political conflict between Ali and Muawiya RA
> Arbitrators decided to remove both from power and elect a new caliph. Group of Ali RA support shouted the famous verse "Judgement is for Allah alone" they left Ali RA camp and became the Khawarij who adopted the belief that the sinning believer -> disbeliever and used that to terrorise other muslims. Ali RA began to fight them and slowly reduce them in number. Their attempt on Muawiya's life failed but they were successful in assassinating Ali RA whilst he was praying.

Naturally caliphate rule fell the biggest authority left, Muawiya RA

### 4. Establishment of the Islamic State

Umayyad Rule: 661 - 750

661 - 680: Muawiya RA  
Initial deal with Hasan RA that he would give up any claims of caliphate and spend his days as a scholar and worshipper. The role and style of a Caliph changed with Muawiya to resemble the Kings/Emperors of other nations and change to a Monarchy system of succession.

670 - 680: Uqba ibn Nafi RA campaigned throughout North Africa especially through Berber lands weakening the Byzantines further  
674 - 678: Attempt to siege Constantinople failed, and Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari was martyred and buried near the wall.

He controversially appointed his son Yazid as his successor well before his death and demanded bayah from other regional leaders. 

Yazid faced allegations of a life unbefitting of a Caliph, accusations of Alcohol, singing girls and other luxuries were levied. 

Husain RA given promises by people of Kufa to support him against Yazid so decided to migrate to Kufa against the warning of Abdullah ibn Zubair that the Kufans would not truly support him. When Yazid sent his governor to Kufa to stamp out the opposition the Kufans abandoned their support for Husain before he arrived.  
Battle of Karbala: Husain RA surrounded and killed by Yazid's forces  
680: Abdullah ibn Zubair declares revolt against Yazid   
683: Yazid passes away

Rebellion still continued all over the caliphate  
683 - 634: Mu'awiya ibn Yazid  
684 - 685: Marwan  
685 - 705: Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan  
> 692: Rebellions finally quelled across the empire

**Moving on Spain:**   
711: Tariq ibn Ziyad (berber convert) sent with army and established camp on mountain island that became known as Jabal Tariq (Gibraltar)  
711 - 715: Most of Iberian Penisula under Umayyad rule  
720s: Parts of southern France under Muslim rule  
732: Battle of Tours, Muslims defeated by the Franks in northern France 

**Moving on India:**

Trade vessel was attacked near Sindh and King of Sindh refused to return Muslim captives.  
711: Muhammad ibn Qasim sent with 6k soldiers and established Muslim rule in Sindh  

> Mid 700s estiamted muslim population of the empire was only 10%.   
> Largest empire in the world in just after 100 years 


**Fall of the Umayyads**

Jizya made it more favourable for new citizens to convert but that also reduces income for governorship so a policy that new converts still had to pay jizya was instated. Unfavourable for all non-arabs because they were all the new converts which led to a non-arabs having a foul view of the Umayyads.

712 - 720: Umar bin Abdul Aziz (known as 5th rightly guided caliph) took power and worked to undo the Unislamic policies of the Umayyads. His own clan/family were not pleased with him and poisoned him. 

**Abbasid:**
Named after lineage of Abbas, Uncle to the Prophet SAW.
Initial rumour that a descendant of Ali RA had passed the baton of leadership to the lineage of Abbas.

730 - 740s: Initial agreements and pledges of allegiance  
747: Abassids declared Oh testing 123 declared the official open revolt led by a mysterious figure code Abu Muslim

Official military fight against the Umayyads began and Khurasan was taken. Kufa rebelled against its governor.
750: Abbasids Army completely defeated the Umayyads  
Members of the family were hunted and executed and Marwan was captured in Egypt. One of the family escaped to Andrews which is where an Umayyad emirate would last for almost 300 years separate to the Abbasids.  
765: Capital established in Baghdad which became the largest city in the world with over 1 million residents

### 5. Golden Age of Islam

**Bayt ul Hikmah:**  
813 - 833: 7th Abbasid Caliph Al Ma'mun put heavy emphasis on intellectual development  
Pros:
1. 1st time ever scholars could gather in one place to focus, discuss and develop various sciences. 
2. Arabic being a universal language for muslim intellectuals allowed scholars from various regions to cooperate.

**Mathematics:** 
780 - 850: Kharizmi 
 - Adopted the Indian numeral system
 - Developed algebra 

1048 - 1131: Omar Khayyam
 - Method for solving cubic equations
 - Binomial Theorem

**Medicine:** 

Muhammad ibn Zakaria al-Razi: Refuted Galen to argue that medical ailments can be traced to a physical cause.

Ibn Sina: Wrote The Canon of Medicine which was still used in the 17th Century. 
 - Argued illness is due to a chain of physical events. 
 - Proposed that drugs should be tested in controlled settings.
 - Categorised diseases and how they spread.

**Astronomy:**  
Al-Biruni:
- First proposed that the Earth may spin on its own axis

Muslim scholars further expanded the Astrolabe to help calculate prayer times and aid navigation on journeys.

**Geography:**

Abbasid scholars calculated the earths circumference and diameter and were only off by 30-ish kilometres using only trigonometry and circle geometry.

Muhammad al-Idrissi in 12th Century Sicily created a world map unrivalled inaccuracy in detail which was used for hundreds of years afterwards and records an account of Muslim sailors who ventured 31 days across the Atlantic Ocean and arrived at Unknown piece of land, most likely the Americas.

**Physics:**

Al-Haytham wrote a book called the book of Optics which argued that light was composed of rays travelling straight lines and built the Camera Obscura to prove his theory leading to the development of a camera 1000 years later. He also calculated the depth of the earth's atmosphere which was only verified once spacecraft left the Earth and was also the founder and developer of the scientific method.

Al-Jazari in the 12th century was known for designing and building automatic machines such as clocks, music robots and hand washing machines powered by water.

13th century the Muslim world was filled with machines such as crankshafts, water pumps and robots.

### 6. Development of the Islamic Uloom

 > All Islamic sciences stem from the attempt to interpret and understand the Quran and the Prophet's SAW example
   
Fiqh:   
The development of jurisprudence represents the challenge of early scholars in knowing how to apply the early example of the profit to a changing and dynamic world.

Development of 4 madhabs and their relevant frameworks (usul).  
- Qiyas
- Actions of people of Madina etc   

**Aqeedah:** 
Khawarij first to engage to prove their position that sinners are disbelievers.  
Mu'tazila came next with their incorrect usage of logic and gained backing especially by Al-Mamun which led to famous conflict with Imam Ahmad.
Abu'l Hasan Al-Ashari and Abu Mansur Al-Maturidi step onto the scene with their refutations of both the incorrect Mu'tazali application of logic and also the extreme aversion to rational discourse of faith by Imam Ahmad. 
Leads to the development of the 3 sunni schools that are around today, Ashari, Maturidi and Athari schools.

**Tasawwuf:**   
Science of spirituality which became canonised from 12th - 15th Centuries by figures such as Abdul Qadir Al-Jilani, Mohinuddin Chisti, Ibn Arabi and Abul Hasan Ash-shadhili into their respective turuq (paths). Each sheikh of the tariqa would have mureeds that they would certify when ready to take on their own mureeds to continue the tariqa.

**Shi'ism:**

Originally stemmed as a political group who believed Ali RA should have been caliph instead of Abu Bakr. That position led them to hold the caliphs before Ali RA and those that supported them to be usurpers which led them to not trust their hadiths. They rejected the concept of Caliphate and replaced it with Imamate where each imam a descendant of the Prophet is chosen and is God's infallible representative on Earth.

Main branch is Twelver Shi'ism that believes there are 12 imams after the Prophet ending with Imam Muhahammad al-Mahdi in 874 when he went into hiding at 5 years old. Began the period of Minor Occultation where special representatives were able to communicate with him and receive guidance for the community but in 941 it was announced that the imam went into Major Occultation and communication with him became impossible.

Who would only return toward the end of times. Alongside the Twelvers are the Seveners and the Zaydis who believe in 5 imams.

It would only become a major force in the 1500s with the rise of Safavids.

### 7. Upheaval

**Ismail'ism:** 
The Seveners became known as the Ismailis who were much more politically active than Twelvers and spread missionaries throughout major cities in the Muslim world to garner support. They were popular among lower classes and non-Arabs who resented an Arab rule and traditional bedouins who always hated central authority.

903: Unexpectedly captured Damascus's undefeated domestic army then forced back out into Arabian desert just two years later  
906: Massacred 20,000 people travelling to Mecca for the pilgrimage  
928: Attacked Mecca massacred his population and stole the black stone from the Ka'bah moving it to Bahrain where it remained till 952
       
But they never became a real threat until another Ismaili movement rose on the backs of Berbers to become regional power.  

Fatimids:  
The missionaries built up support from North Africa where they declared the reappearance of a leader who claimed to be a descendent of Ali and Fatima leading to the name Fatimids. They quickly gained control of western North Africa.

969: Conquered Egypt, founded the city of Cairo along the banks of the Nile  
970: Al-Azhar university was established to spread Ismaili thought and belief

**TODO Mad King Al-Hakim**

Finally defeated by Salahuddin Al-Ayyubi during the crusades.

**Crusades:** The 200-year conflict started in 1095 and centred around the city of Jerusalem.

Background
1037: Seljuk Empire established from turkish nomadic warriors that accepted Islam and moved from Central Asia. Began expanding territory and continuing to threaten the Byzantines.
1095: Byzantine emperor writes letter to Pope Urban II in Rome requesting aid from fellow Christian kingdom. Pope decided to mobilise the army instead to take back Jerusalem that was holy for Christians and had been under Muslim rule since Umar. 30,000 strong army marched towards Jerusalem.

1097: Siege of Antioch, the population put to the sword
> Turkish emirs at that point had become involved in petty rivalry no one came to the aid of Antioch when they requested help. Other Muslim leaders knowing the army's ultimate goal was Jerusalem gave them food, arms and passage to save themselves.

1099: Army reached the walls Jerusalem, with 1 week siege leading to Crusaders entering the city on 15 July 1099 and civilians being put to death.
> Muslim world was obviously hit hard by the loss of the 3rd holiest site, Fatimids tried to back the city but failed. The Turks were indulged in civil war and the Abassids were just a name the muslims were in no position to fight back. 

Crusaders were unchallenged due to the inability of the Muslim world at the time to respond so fortified their power along Syrian and Palestine coast leading to 4 Crusader kingdoms.

1144: Turkish Imad al-Din Zengi gathered forces and took the County of Edessa, the weakest Crusader state but the beginning of the changing tide.

1154: Nur al-Din Zengi (Imads son) overthrew Damascus emir who had alliance with Crusaders

1163: Jerusalem King led invasion into Fatimid Egypt under pretence of lack of tribute  
1164: Fatimids seek assistance from Nur al-Din Zengi who comes to assist and fights off the Crusaders. Fatimids regain power and force Zengi's forces out the city. Crusaders come again, repeat but Zengi deposed the treacherous Fatimid Vizier. 

1169: Yusuf, Salahuddin nephew to one of Zengi's generals is appointed as Vizier.

**Liberation of Jerusalem:**  

Azhar university converted into a traditional Sunni school.

1174: Nur al-Din Zengi passes away, Salahuddin enters Syria and becomes undisputed leader uniting Egypt and Syrian sides.

Crusaders were suffering from internal conflicts and fringe groups such as Knights Templar.

Hashishin (extreme group of Ismaili's) became a thorn in Salahuddin's side with constant assassination attempts.

1187: Battle of Hattin, Salahuddin takes Jerusalem after Crusader king broke peace treaties and harmed pilgrims.

Salahuddin's territory became the Ayyubid dynasty and 20 years after Jerusalem conquer Gengis Khan steps on the scene.

**Mongols:**  
Central Asian nomads who were experienced warriors and expert horse riders.

Mongols would present their targets 3 options:  
1. Surrender and join the army
2. Army resist, if Mongols succeed entire garrison put to death
3. Army and Civilians resist with promise that both would be completed wiped out when Mongols are successful

No wonder certain regions didn't even bother fighting.

1219: Mongols face and defeat Khwarezmians, the first fight against the Muslims  
1222: Khwarezmian empire completely destroyed  
1225: Gengis Khan dies 

1250: Ayyubid dynasty overthrow by its own slave soldiers to become the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt

1255: 100,000 army gathered by Mongols with aim to wipe out Muslims completely. (Growing Christian influence within the upper echelons of the Mongols)

1256: Hashasin wiped out by Mongols  
10 Feb 1258: 1 week siege leads to Baghdad being conquered, pillaged and everyone massacred.

1260: Mongols march into Palestine stopped by the Mamluks.

Mongol khan in Russia converts to Islam and becomes ally to the Mamluks.

Ibn Taymiyyah (1263 - 1328) provided response to weakening of faith amongst the masses after loss of caliphate that this was only due to the ruling class not following the correct practice of Islam. It inevitably led to conflict with Mongol and Mamluk leaders leading to his imprisonment and death in Damascus.

### 8. Andalus

710s: Muslims began entering the Iberian Penisula.

750: Abdurahman 20 year old Umayyad prince escapes Damascus seeking shelter in Andalus amongst the Berbers, having a Berber mother himself.

912 - 961: Abdulrahman III declared himself caliph with Cordoba as the capital. Cordoba became a land of learning and technology.

**Taifa Period:**

1009: Suleiman II overthrew another Umayyad using Castilians and Berbers to attack Cordoba and declared himself Caliph.

Muslim leaders started fighting each other and even paying Christian leaders to attack other Muslim leaders within the Peninsula. Christian states began flourishing and attacking, stealing land and territory from the Muslims.

Unable to fight back they sought help from the Morrocan Murabbitun movement. 

1026: Yusuf ibn Tashfin crosses Gibraltar with 12,000 soldiers.

Oct 1086: Battle of Zallaqa, decisive victory over Castillians.

1090: Yusuf ibn Tashfin's 3rd entry in Andalus armed with Fatwa from Imam Ghazali that the Taifa kings are unfit to rule. He took control of Andalus with some Muslim kings uniting with Christians to oppose him.

1100s: Iberian Penisula was only 20% Christian population.

1147: Muwahiddun movement attacked Murabbitun and took control of Morocco.

Andalus overthrew the Murabbitun movement as they weakened and stopped gaining military victories. Christian kings took advantage and went on the offensive again.

1212: Pope Innocent III called for a European crusade to attack the Muwahiddun movement.

1228 - 1248: Valencia, Sevilla, Badajoz, Majorca, Murcia, Jaen and others fell due to Christian attack.  
1236: Cordoba fell to Castillians.

Last part of Muslim Andalus left was the Emirate of Granada. Nasrids of Granada managed to hang on by paying tribute and even assisting in defeating other Muslim leaders.

1482: The Emir of Granada overthrown by his son.  
1486: Son captured by Castillians, Father retakes the throne, Son released on agreement to fight for throne becomes Emir again leading to civil war against Uncle. Eventually retires from the civil war allowing Uncle to fight the Castillians.

1490: Granada last muslim city left in the Penisula.

1 January 1492: Granada handed over to the Spanish.

10% of Iberian Penisula was still Muslim, so first they were monetarily incentivised to convert but backfired because people were found to take the payment then found doing Muslim prayers.

1499: Catholic Archbishop appointed to speed up process. He focused on persecution and imprisonment which led to defiance allowed the Monarchs to state it was either conversion or death penalty. 

1502: Islam outlawed in Spain.  
1502: Fatwa by Mufti of Oran (Algeria), allowed tayammum instead of wudhu and salah to be prayed at night as a substitute for the day.

**Spanish Inquisition:**

1511: Halal slaughter was banned.
1513: Women were banned from covering their face.

1609: All Moriscos (the Spanish Muslims or their descendants who became baptized Christians) exiled from Spain.

### 9. Edge

**West Africa:**

First Muslims coming to West Africa were traders crossing the Sahara desert that settled in West Africa, as a result Islam spread slowly amongst the native population sometimes just in name. People would accept Islam but still hold on to previous beliefs.

**Mali:**
Founded in 1200s, it is the first native Muslim kingdom with the founder taking on the title Mansa.

1312 - 1337: Mansa Musa, most famous King of Mali known in history. Most of what we know about Mali come from accounts of his Hajj trip in 1324. He departed with 60,000 entourage, 12,000 with him wearing silk and carrying 2kg of gold each. His visit to Egypt ruined the economy for many years because of the sudden influx of precious metals. He realised Mali lacked scholars and knowledge so then began to recruit scholars to come back to Mali to teach.

Mali's knowledge hub founded in Timbuktu and went on to become one of the leading centres of Islamic knowledge in the world such that scholars would have to first go to Morocco to study preliminaries before studying in Timbuktu.


**East Africa:**

Islam had been present ever since the time of the Prophet SAW when companions went to Ethiopia. Merchants from Arab Penisula especially Hadramawt settled in East African cities and intermarried with native women. Like West Africa main source of the spread of Islam was commerce. Cities opened their doors to these wealthy merchants and they became integrated in the native culture to the extent Swahili which is a native African language now has many Arabic loanwords.

**African Slavery and The Americas:**

Estimated 3-6 million of the 15-20 million slaves taken to America were Muslim. Their life was one of restriction and subjugation which meant there was difficulty in practicing their faith let alone passing on knowledge. By the mid 1800s there were few Muslims left with knowledge of Islam. But a revival came during the 20th Century due to the Nation of Islam, a racial religion combining Islam and Christianity.

1960: Malcolm X former NOI member steered people away from NOI to the mainstream understanding of Islam after his personal experience whilst performing Hajj.

**China:**

~650: Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas was sent as an ambassador by Uthman ibn Affan
750s: Tang Dynasty invited Muslims soldiers to join the army, so they settled there married locally etc

Mongol invasion of China led to mass movements of people which led to a massive influx of Muslims into China and they became integrated locally and recognised as the Hui Chinese people.

Most famous Chinese Muslim Zheng He (1371 - 1433) is known as the nations finest explorer. He was given command of a number of ships to make trade journeys and is known for spreading Islam in Malay Archipelago and a number of Mosques are named him where was locally known as Cheng Ho.

**India:**

After Muhammad ibn Qasim's influence in the 700s, Islam was restricted to Sindh and didn't spread much.

First expeditions in to India were by a Turkic Sultan who established himself in the Afghan highlands he laid the foundations of future conquests in India. The succeeding Ghurid dynasty, also ruled out of Afghanistan and they managed to capture Delhi in the year 1192 ironically though they were overturned by their own slave soldiers like the Mamluks who then called themselves the Delhi sultanate. Dehli sultanate ruled over parts of India from 1206 to 1526 when the Mughals arrived. Islam managed to find a foothold in India despite the Muslim population never outnumbering the Hindus particularly because of the Egalitarian nature of Islam which offered an escape from the Hindu caste system as well as Sufi orders being sponsored by the state.

**Southeast Asia:**

The Malay archipelago first experience Islam was due to traders and commerce. Then around the 1100s when local rulers began converting to Islam Muslim empires began to rise and it's through these rulers that the religion spread across the local population. Most of the missionaries tended to come from Yemen which of course led to the school of Fiqh being Imam Shafi's as opposed to India where the Muslims were of a Persian origin and hence them being Hanafi's.

We know from Marco Polo in the 1200s the island of Sumatra had the first Muslim state known as Pasai.
### 10. Rebirth

> **Ibn Khaldun:** Dynasties have a natural lifespan. The early years of a dynasty are characterized by expansive growth, a "desert toughness", an ethos of hard work and little desire for worldly luxuries. The second generation of the dynasty continues in the legacy of the founders, but growth slows as leaders begin to place more emphasis on the luxuries of urban palace life than on administration and leadership. By the third generation, the decay of the dynasty is complete as the leaders and viziers are so consumed by luxury and pleasure that the state cannot protect itself from internal or external threats due to the negligence of the rulers. At that point, the cycle begins all over again as a new dynasty rises to replace the old, decrepit one.

Mid - Late 13th Century = 3rd Phase

**Ottomans:**  
14-15th Century: Rise of the Ottomans from Anatolia

Muslims fleeing Mongol slaughter and Weakening of the Byzantine empire led to Osman Bey taking advantage, expanding and gaining Byzantine land. 1333, Byzantine Emperor met with Ottoman leader to establish safety agreement in exchange for tributes. 1350s, Ottomans began expanding into European land, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece were conquered. 1402, Timur Muslim Mongol leader fought Ottomans at Battle of Ankara leading to capture of Ottoman leader who was taken back to Samarkand. Ottoman leadership was fought for by 4 sons of previous leader. 11 years of civil war due to lack of proper succession policy which was not introduced until 17th century.

1451: Muhammad Al Fatih takes leadership for 2nd time at 19   
He was fluent in 6 languages and placed emphasis on Islamic uloom, the vizier class were sceptical of him as a leader so he decided to prove his worth by taking Constantinople. He commissioned a Hungarian engineer to construct the worlds largest cannon which could shoot a 250kg cannonball 1.5km and constructed a fortress along the Bosphorus to control the sea. 
1453: Constantinople conquered 
Ottoman expansion continued, Mamluks in Egypt were annexed hence the Abbasid caliphate in name was gone and Hijaz was now under Ottoman rule it de facto became the main Islamic power in the world. 

**Safavids:**  
Turkish sufi group that adopted Twelver Shi'ism became known as the Safavids, eventually took over Persia. Twelver Shi'ism and Persian Nationalism merged to become the main identity of the Safavids. Ottomans annexed some land but failed to take the rest and the Turkey Iran split is basically the same border as the Ottoman Safavid ones. 

**Mughals:**  
Founded 1526 by Turkic conqueror Barbur after battle of Panipat against Delhi Sultanate. Became a diverse mix of cultures to the extent Akbar founded his own religion Din-e Ilahi which was supposed to accommodate all religions but didn't catch on.

Aurangzeb was the culmination of the trend of reverting back to orthodoxy and he commissioned a Hanafi work ***Fatawa-e Alamgiri*** which was the legal code for the state. Criticised by western academics as being religiously intolerant due to accounts of destroying temples, author refutes this by saying those specific accounts are linked to revolts which were organised in said temples, marking the move as a political not religious one. 

3 Gunpowder empires: Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal were the main structure of the muslim world. Sharing a core but differing in political and at times islamic values. 

### 11. Decline

***Ottomans:***   

1699: Treaty of Karlowitz  - post 14 year battle Ottomans forced to concede land for the first time ever. Ottoman sultan was forced by the treaty to recognize and protect Christians in the empire. (A theme which would continue in subsequent treaties as Ottomans weakened further.)

"Ottomans reached their natural maximum size." - Personally think this isn't an accurate statement the maximum size of an empire is dictated by parameters which change with time and it just so happened the policies were not in accordance to the size of the empire at the time. 

Key Factors:
 - Late 1500s Sultans stopped going to battle
 - Tradition of Princes fighting for the throne stopped, govt officials would pick oldest as defacto leader. Other family members were kept secluded in harems and not trained to be leaders so if they were picked were incompetent.
 - Influx of silver from US into Europe led to major inflation for Ottoman currency
 - Renaissance and Enlightenment led to technological progress in Europe
 - Wars on the edges of the empire led to constant loss of territory 
 - International trade was taken out of Muslim hands as Ottomans made bad deals with the French who choose to only trade with Christians in the Ottoman lands 
 - 1800s: Liberal reform of Ottoman state to mirror European mainly the French. French was taught alongside Turkish in schools, national anthem added etc.
 - Nationalism as a concept began spreading amongst ethnic groups under Ottoman rule such as the Greeks etc

Sultan Abdul Hamid II came along and reverted some of the reform bringing power back to the Sultan, reinforcing the Muslim identity of the state and idea of Caliphate. Hijaz railway from Madina to Istanbul was made. Pan-Islamism was a major goal and he sent delegation to Muslim nations/groups across the world to garner oral support which would act as a deterrent. 

> Theodore Herzl (Founder of Zionism) met with Sultan Abdulhamid II who turned down Herzl's offer to consolidate the Ottoman debt in exchange for a charter allowing the Zionists access to Palestine.

1909: Sultan Abdulhamid II  was removed from power by the Young Turks 

***India:***

Post Aurangzeb Mughal central authority over the smaller sovereigns across India waned leading to each group attempting to create their own independent state. Pashtuns in the North taking land from Safavid and Mughals which would lead to modern day Afghanistan. Sikhs established independent dominion in Punjab. Marathas, Hindu group conquered most of Northern and Central India by the mid-1700s. Another independent Mysore state in the South.  

East India Company, already present in India from 1600s funded wars to obtain special trading rights becoming advisers and tax collectors for most of the local rulers. 1857, Sepoy Mutiny Indian soldiers in the Company's Army rebelled against the British which led to the British government seizing the Company's land and turn India into British Raj an official colony officially ending the Mughal empire. The resentment for the mutiny were brewing for a while but finally kicked off when it got leaked that the cartridges for their guns which they had to bite was greased with Beef and Pork.

***Africa, Central and South East Asia***

Most of North Africa was conquered and placed under European rule very quickly. Egypt successfully defended itself and had a trade relationship with Europe with the French sponsoring the Suez Canal in 1869. 1882, British conquest of Egypt takes place and they occupied Egypt until treaty of 1922 and 1936 which gave Egypt gradual control back. West Africa was mostly taken by the French and East Africa by the British.

Central Asia, Russia focused on taking the Turkish lands which triggered the British in India to rival them over Afghanistan leading to a period of time known as the Great Game. 

East Asia, Dutch East India Company spread through the Malay Archipelago just like the British East India Company leading to Dutch empire that lasted even after 2nd World War.

1914 1st World War, most of the Muslims were under foreign rule. 

### 12. Old and New Ideas

The success of Islam first as conquests, then as the major contributor towards scientific advancement and then as a global power was seen as a proof of it being true until the European conquest. This led to potential theological issues which had people divided into two camps. The first stated success would only return if people returned to the Islamic focus of the people of the past. The second saying it was necessary to imitate the West to attain similar success.

**The Western Approach**

The rise of the Western idea of secularism and nationalism coincided with Muslims living under European rule. Western trends permeated Arab society. Arab Christians had extensive contact with European merchants due to the Capitulation agreements with the Ottomans. With these developments the thought of Arab national identity began growing. After 1909, after Sultan Abdul Hamid II was overthrown by the secular Young Turks leading to Arabs feeling less included in the Ottoman empire nationalist Arab identity further grew. 

**Traditional Revivalists**

Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab (1703 - 1792):
One of the first to try revive "traditional" Islam and thought it was necessary to go back to the way of the Salaf and fight the Sufis, Shias etc. He like the Kharijis determined most muslims have fallen into disbelief. He partnered with tribal lead Muhammad Ibn Saud to support him if he allowed Ibn Abdul Wahhab's to proliferate his way of thought, evolving into what became known as Salafism. Early 1800s, Ibn Saud conquered most of the Arabian peninsula. 

Shah Waliullah (1703 - 1762):
A scholar who feared for the Muslims due to disunity, civil wars and the rise of Hindu political power due to disunity and civil wars of Mughal India. He focused on the social aspects of Islam and encouraged people to return back to a more Islamic oriented way of living to bring back the success of the Muslims.

Hasan Al-Banna (1906 - 1949):
Egyptian school teacher who founded the Muslim Brotherhood who merged Islamic values and Arab nationalism hitting a balance between the traditionalists and the completely secular Egyptian state power. They set up schools, hospitals etc which led them to being popular amongst Egyptians leading to persecution for decades from the state dedicated to complete secularism. 

**The Partition**

1914: WW1 began and the Ottoman government run by the Young Turks supported Germany against Britain, France and Russia. Eventually, the Ottomans lost the war. 
1915: British were speaking to Sharif Husayn, the Ottoman governor of Makkah to create an Arab revolt. Sharif armed and supported by the British led the rebellion taking Madina, Amman and Damascus from the Ottomans. The British on the other side kept Egypt and took Jerusalem for the first time from Muslim hands since the Crusades.

British and the French split up the lands amongst themselves not fulfilling the agreement with Sharif. French took North Syria and Lebanon. Britain took Mesopotamia and Palestine as part of the Skyes-Picot agreement.

1917: Arthur Balfour, foreign secretary of the UK sent letter to Baron Rothschild (Jewish Banker) promising support for a national home for the Jewish. Background context is that the Zionist movement had been seeking a national home for the Jews in Palestine. It became known as the Balfour Declaration and legitimacy for the Jews to settle and control the land leading to the state of Israel.

**The Rise of Nation-States**
Post-effective Ottoman collapse and splitting up of states amongst the European conquerors along with Arab-Turk nationalistic identity. Ottoman army officer, Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk - Father of the Turks) fought out the occupiers (1919 - 1922) and announced the state of Turkey to replace the Ottoman Empire (623 years it was founded).

He saw success in riding Turkey of its Islamic origin and focusing on the identity of the Turks. 
1924: Caliph AbdulMajid II forced into exile -> End of Caliphate
> Hijab, Fez, Sufi Orders and the Arabic adhan were banned later
> Replaced Arabic alphabet for Turkish with the Latin alphabet

Out of Ottoman Syria and Mesopotamia -> Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine.
Balfour Declaration -> Jews were allowed to settle in the Mandate of Palestine.

Iraq borders drawn so that Sunni Arabs, Sunni Kurds and Shia Arabs were each 1/3 of the population inevitably leading to years of ethnic/religious conflict. 

1918: ~60,000 Jews in Palestine
1939: ~460,000 Jews in Palestine
Demographic shift was unwelcomed by the Arabs living there leading to the 1930s riots.
1948: State of Israel was created
Arab coalition failed to defeat Israel leading to more land under Israeli rule. 
1948-49: >700,000 Arab Muslims and Christians were forced out to Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. Israeli state sought to put the demographics in their favour by way of expulsion known as the Nakba (Catastrophe). 

**India:**

1857: Sepoy Rebellion
Late 1800s: Indian National Congress formed to fight for greater political rule, dominated by Hindus as they were the majority of the population. Seen as an issue by certain Muslims they pushed for an independent state. Muhammad Iqbal and Ali Jinnah led the Pakistan movement, a push for a Muslim state. 1947: The British ended their direct control of the region and the state of Pakistan was established of Northwest (Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan) and East (Bengal).

> Pakistan is the acronym of Muslim majority parts of India. (Punjab, Afghania Province, Kashmir, Sindh and Baluchistan)

1949: Indonesia became independent after a long war with Dutch empire
1952: Egypt Revolution ended British occupation
1962: Algeria regained independence after being under French occupation 
1960s: Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania, Kenya and Tanzania became independent.

**Islam and Secularism**


1971: East Pakistan became a separate state Bangladesh
1967-1973: Lack of effective unity of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon meant they were constantly defeated by Israel

For the first time in history, the idea of Muslims running states based on Islamic rule was not the given and instead secularism became the methodology of the day besides exceptions like Saudi Arabia. 

Amongst current Muslim society is a dichotomy of some arguing that Islam as a religion no longer has a place or as important a role to play in running a state and others claiming it is the only way to run a state. We see these fighting methodologies being played out in the current world in the likes of Turkey, Saudi Arabia. Not so long ago, in Egypt, Tunisia and Syria during the Arab Spring.

> Whether Islam once again plays a vital role or Secularism is the dominant methodology or a merger of the two is left to be seen for the future.
