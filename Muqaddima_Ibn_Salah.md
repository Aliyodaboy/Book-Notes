Ml Zeeshan's introduction to uloom ul hadith

This science helps identify whether a hadith is authentic. The two primary skills to gain by studying this science Takhreej and Tahqeequl Isnad.

Takhreej: Sourcing a hadith.
e.g. X hadith is in Sahih Muslim 

Tahqeequl Isnad: Analysing the chain of the hadith by looking at the narrators and providing a grading.

Those two things are only possible if one is familiar with the technical terms the scholars in this field use. Once one familiarises themselves with the terms of this science, it's easier to navigate the books of hadith.

The origin of this science goes back to when scholars began using terms to describe phenomena they saw concerning hadith. Scholars started using terms like Sahih and Daeef, but the definitions were not penned down. Then discussions regarding hadith began to be written down.

Imam Muslim includes discussions he deems relevant in the muqaddima to his sahih.
Imam Tirmidhi writes Kitabul 3illal, discussing the defects regarding hadith.
Imam Abu Dawud wrote a letter to the people of Makkah when he authored his sahih, explaining some of his usul for hadith.

None of these were comprehensive for studying the science of hadith. Students of this science would sit in the majalis of a hadith scholar, collecting the hadith being narrated and noting any remarks the scholar mentions regarding the hadith/narrators. As a competent student, you would begin analysing the hadith you have collected by finding out what scholars say regarding certain narrators and sifting through your collection to accurately determine a grading for your hadiths. That lengthy process was the pathway to becoming a hadith scholar. There was no single book as a sufficient introduction to the science. 

Muhaddith Al-Faasil by Ramahurmuzi (360H) is considered the first comprehensive book on the rules of narration. Discusses topics such as what is the appropriate age to narrate hadith. 

The first book that provides an introduction to the science of hadith is معرفة علوم الحديث لأبو عبد الله الحاكم النيسابوري  (405H).

Ibn Salah gathered the information in earlier books and codified it all within his book. His book changed the field, and most if not all books after him are reliant on his book. Hence there are many mukhtasars of his book one of the most famous being Imam Nawawi's (التقريب والتيسير لمعرفة سنن البشير النذير).
