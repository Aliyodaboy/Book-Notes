Background: 
- teaching Stanford students to deal with cold calling situations 

spontaneous speaking is the most common situation humans find themselves in

Listen first to understand where the person is and what they want

Structure the answer so its easier for first yourself and the receiver to understand


1. Manage Anxiety
 a. symptoms
     - deep belly breath, exhale longer than inhale
 b. sources 
    - there is no right way to communicate, there is no such thing as perfect
    "Maximum mediocrity in the moment" so you have more mental bandwith to focus on what you are saying not how well you are doing it

    - reframe situations from being an attack to an oppourtunity to learn, grow



Scenarios:

1. How to get your point through in a busy meeting?
    - Leverage paraphasing: use a topic already being discussed, highlight and then bring in your point
    - Use a question to grab other's attention to highlight your point
    - Emotion: e.g. if cost is being discussed "I am concerned about how the cost of X is going to be managed" etc

2. As a meeting driver, how do you ensure different voices are heard?
 a. In advance of the meeting:
    - set the meeting expectations upfront via the meeting invitation or something els. set the expectation that we want to hear from everyone
    - Go to the usual suspects and tell them either "I know you got stuff to say can you wait for others to speak first" or "I want to hear your thoughts can you raise anything that comes to mind" respective if they are loud or quiet voice
 b. In the actual meeting
    - if someone is going on and on, interupt by cherry picking something they said and use it to bring the conversation back to the topic at hand or turn the attention to someone else "you mentioned X that's interesting I would like to hear what Y thinks of X"

3. Reducing the usage of the filler words
 - Filler words hold the floor whilst you need to formulate your point
 - Adults teach children new concepts with filler words. They will say "erm" then explain the concept whihc teaches children what comes after a filler word is important.

 Apps to help reduce filler words:
  - Poised
  - LikeSo

 Technique: Speak in a manner such that you are out of breath at the end of every sentence because its impossible to say anything whilst you are inhaling for the next sentence

4. How to use gestures when talking or presenting?
 - Gesture beyond your shoulders
 - When you are not gesturing keep them in sight. Have a neutral resting place. 

 2 types of gestures:
  1. Emphatic gestures
  2. Descriptive gestures 

- Record and watch yourself in 3 ways
    1. 2x speed without audio
    2. Listen without picture
    3. Audio and Video
